#Project Title: Smart Insurance Contracts - Proof of Concept (POC)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Proof of Concept (POC) project on Smart Insurance Contracts. The objective of this POC is to explore the potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts in the insurance industry. The project aims to develop a transparent and efficient system for purchasing and managing insurance policies, leveraging the benefits of blockchain and decentralized applications (DApps).

## Features

1. **Smart Contracts**: The core of the project consists of Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity. These smart contracts handle the insurance purchase, claim submission, approval, and premium calculations.

2. **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**: NFTs are utilized to create unique digital assets that represent ownership of insurance policies. Each policyholder receives an NFT as proof of their valid insurance.

3. **Premium Calculation**: The project includes a component to calculate insurance premiums based on the policyholder's driving style. Simulated driving data is used to demonstrate the premium calculation process.

## Technologies Used

- Ethereum: Blockchain platform for smart contract execution.
- Solidity: Programming language for smart contracts.
- Remix IDE: Web-based development environment for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- HTML and JavaScript: Used for the frontend interface and simulated data.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including an Ethereum client and Remix IDE.
3. Deploy the smart contracts using Remix IDE or a development blockchain network.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to access the frontend interface.

## Usage

1. Access the frontend interface to interact with the smart contracts.
2. Perform KYC verification and purchase an insurance policy.
3. Simulate driving data to calculate insurance premiums based on different scenarios.
4. Submit and approve insurance claims using the smart contracts.
5. Explore the NFTs representing valid insurance policies.
